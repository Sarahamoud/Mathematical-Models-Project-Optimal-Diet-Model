Mathematical Models Project – Optimal Diet Model
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a mathematical model designed to optimize a daily diet plan for a 10-year-old child suffering from obesity. The goal was to minimize total caloric intake while ensuring that all essential nutritional requirements (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals) are met.

The work includes data collection, model formulation, constraints definition, and solving the optimization problem using Excel’s Solver tool.

🔍 Problem Statement

The project focuses on a child whose BMI indicates obesity. The goal is to determine:

The minimum number of calories the child should eat daily.

Which nutritional components must be included.

A daily & weekly meal plan that supports gradual weight loss.

Whether the solution is feasible using available and familiar food items.

🧮 Mathematical Model

We formulate a linear optimization problem:

Decision Variables:

Constraints:

Required nutritional ranges for:

Needed minimum levels for:
fiber, cholesterol, sodium, iron, magnesium, calcium, vitamins C & E

Availability and realistic consumption limitations.

🧰 Tools Used

Excel

Excel Solver

Calculations based on nutritional tables

📊 Results

A feasible diet plan was found.

New constraints significantly improved practical food variety.

Final optimized calorie intake: 1275 kcal per day.

A full weekly menu was generated based on Solver results.

📅 Weekly Diet Plan

A daily and weekly food plan was created based on optimized food amounts to ensure weight reduction within 40 weeks while maintaining sufficient nutrition.

✅ Conclusions

The optimization model successfully generated a realistic diet plan that minimizes calorie intake while fulfilling all nutritional requirements.
This demonstrates how linear programming can be applied to real-life health and nutrition problems.
